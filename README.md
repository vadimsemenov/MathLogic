# Math Logic course by Dmitry Shtukenberg (aka @shd)

## Task1 &mdash; The proof checker for predicate logic

## Task2 &mdash; Deduction method for predicate logic
Transforms Γ, α ⊢ β proof into proof for Γ ⊢ α → β

## To be continued

## TODO:
* `IOUtils`
* make `->` right-associated function (is it possible at all?)
* typedefs (?) for Proof, Assumption, Context (Assumptions + Proved), ...
* other tasks... :)
